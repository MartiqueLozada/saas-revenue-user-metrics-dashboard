# SaaS Revenue & User Metrics Dashboard  

A subscription analytics dashboard built with **SQL + Power BI**, designed to simulate how SaaS companies track **revenue, churn, retention, and acquisition channels**.  

This project demonstrates my ability to translate a business problem into data modeling, KPI design, and dashboard storytelling for decision-making.

## 🔎 Context  
SaaS businesses rely on recurring revenue and user retention. Without clear visibility into revenue streams, churn, and acquisition performance, leaders can’t make data-driven product or strategy decisions.  

This project showcases how a centralized dashboard can highlight performance trends and risks using mock SaaS data.

- **$218.45K** Total Revenue  
- **$8.74K** Avg. Monthly Revenue
